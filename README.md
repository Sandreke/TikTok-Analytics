The best hour to post on #TikTok ♪ based on data!


Various sources suggest certain time ranges, but it doesn't have to work for every creator. Each audience is unique, so a customized solution is necessary for each #ContentCreator

TikTok algorithm works based on many factors, but one very important in boosting your content is that your followers interact as much as possible in the first hours after posting

But... how many hours after posting? How to know when your followers are active to interact?


💡 Therefore, using data from my followers, I developed a #Python 🐍 project that proposes my best hour to post based on the number of active followers within certain hours after posting. I find out these #insights according to each page:

1️⃣ - If I prioritize the first 𝟯 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀 after posting, the best hour is 𝟮𝟭𝗵

2️⃣ - If I prioritize the first 𝟰 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀, the best hour is 𝟮𝟬𝗵

☝️ In this way, I conclude that for MY ACCOUNT the best hour to post is between 𝟮𝟬𝗵 and 𝟮𝟭𝗵
