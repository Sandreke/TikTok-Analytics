🕒 The best hour to post on [TikTok ♪](https://www.tiktok.com/) based on data!


## 🤔 Context

[Various sources](https://www.shopify.com/blog/best-time-to-post-on-tikok#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20study%20by,and%20Friday%20at%205%20a.m.) suggest certain hours, but it doesn't have to work for everyone. Each audience is unique, so a customized solution is necessary for each content creator

[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) algorithm works based on many factors, but one very important in boosting your content is that your followers interact as much as possible in the first hours after posting

But... how many hours after posting? How to know when your followers are active to interact?

## 📚 Input
Therefore, using [data of my followers](https://github.com/Sandreke/TikTok-Analytics/blob/main/Data/Follower%20activity.xlsx) from [TikTok Analytics](https://www.tiktok.com/analytics?tab=Followers), I developed a [Python](https://www.python.org/) 🐍 project that proposes my best hour to post based on the number of active followers within certain hours after posting using rolling sum.

## 💡 Insights:

1️⃣ If I prioritize the first 𝟯 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀 after posting, the best hour is 𝟮𝟭𝗵
